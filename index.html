        <p>Portrait photography or portraiture in photography is a photograph of
       a person or group of people that captures the personality of the subject
       by using effective lighting, backdrops, and poses. A portrait picture
       might be artistic, or it might be clinical, as part of a medical study.
        Frequently, portraits are commissioned for special occasions, such as
         weddings or school events. Portraits can serve many purposes, from
       usage on a personal Web site to display in the lobby of a business.</p>

        <p>Nature photography is a wide range of photography taken outdoors
       and devoted to displaying natural elements such as landscapes,
       wildlife, plants, and close-ups of natural scenes and textures.
       Nature photography tends to put a stronger emphasis on the aesthetic
       value of the photo than other photography genres, such as
       photojournalism and documentary photography.</p>
